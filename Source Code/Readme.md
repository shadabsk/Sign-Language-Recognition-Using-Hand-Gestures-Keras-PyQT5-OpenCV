# Project Title
Sign Language Recognition Using Hand Gestures Keras PyQT5 OpenCV

## Getting Started
All the source code is available inside SourceCode Directory. It requires python version 3.6 as to synchronize with tensorflow.
* Install the required libraries and packages.
* Build the model with name "ASLModel.h5" using cnn_model.py or give any name just modify the line 38 inside "Dashboard.py"
* Download winGuiAuto.py and paste under lib->site-packages
* Start using the application by simply double clicking "Dashboard.py"


### Prerequisites

* python 3.6
* pyqt5, tkinter
* keyboard
* winGuiAuto
* pypiwin32
* pyttsx3
* tensorflow
* keras
* scipy
* opencv
* qimage2ndarray
* keras
* pillow

step 5

```
Installing win32api,win32con,win32gui with the following command
```
```
pip install pypiwin32
```

step 6

```
Installing pyttsx3 with the following command
```
```
pip install pyttsx3
```

step 7

```
Installing tensorflow framework with the following command
```
```
python -m pip install tensorflow --trusted-host files.pythonhosted.org --trusted-host pypi.org --trusted-host pypi.python.org
```
```
For upgradation use the following command
````
```
pip install tensorflow==2.0.0-alpha0
```

step 8

```
Installing keras with the following command
```
```
pip install keras
```
*Note: (if keras doesnt work just replace keras.model to tensorflow.keras.model and keras.preprocessing to tensorflow.keras.preprocessing on line 37 and 156 respectively)*

step 9

```
Installing PIL with the following command
```
```
pip install pillow
```

step 10

```
Installing qimage2ndarray with the following command
```
```
pip install qimage2ndarrays
```

step 11

```
Installing scipy with the following command
```
```
pip install scipy
```

step 12
```
Installing opencv for python with the following commands
```
```
